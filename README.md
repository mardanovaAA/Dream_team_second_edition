# Life-like cellular automaton

The main goal of this program is visualization of evolution of life-like cellular automaton (CA) resembling
Conway's Game of Life. 

The user is able to set parameters of the game, resolution of the grid, speed of evolution and initial generation 
of the game. Initial generation can also be dowloaded from the file and any subsequent generation can be saved to file.

GUI of the program includes visualization of the evolution of CA and manipulating its parameters.
